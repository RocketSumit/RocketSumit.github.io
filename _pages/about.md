Hello and welcome! I’m a Robotics Engineer at the Dyson Robotics Research Lab in Singapore, where I focus on advancing robot manipulation through imitation learning and reinforcement learning methods. Currently, I am also working on next-generation robot vacuums, a challenging and exciting field.

Beyond the lab, I’m passionate about staying active and nurturing creativity. I find joy in yoga, calisthenics, and playing sports. I’m also an avid chess player, a movie and TV show enthusiast, and a budding guitarist. Additionally, I enjoy exploring the latest tech gadgets, always curious about how technology shapes the world around us.

Robotics is more than just a profession for me—it’s a lifelong passion. Whether I’m developing innovative solutions in the lab or sharing ideas with others, I’m always eager to connect and collaborate.
