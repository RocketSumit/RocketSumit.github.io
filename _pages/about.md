Greetings! I'm a Robotics Engineer at Dyson Robot Learning Lab. My focus
lies on robot manipulation using imitation and reinforment learning. My
professional journey has been an exhilarating exploration of robotics,
encompassing humanoids, autonomous driving, soft robots and manipulation arms. Beyond the lab, I
find joy in yoga, calisthenics, chess, movies, TV shows, animes and playing
sports. I'm also a budding guitarist and love exploring the latest tech gadgets.
Let's connect and dive into the exciting realm of robotics together!
